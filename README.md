</p>
<p>
Before installing any files, Internet Information Services (IIS) needs to be enabled. We are installing osTicket locally and it needs IIS in order to function. To turn on IIS, open the Control Panel. From the Control Panel, open Programs and and Turn Windows Features On or Off. Within this menu, expand Internet Information Services, expand Web Management Tools and enable IIS Management Console. Click and expand World Wide Web Services and expand Application Development Features. In Application Development Features, enable CGI and click ok to confirm.

<p>
After enabling IIS, download and install PHP Manager for IIS (PHPManagerforIIS_V1.5.0.msi) from the installtion files folder. Download and install the Rewrite Module (rewrite_amd64_en-US.msi) after installing PHP Manager for IIS.

</p>
<p>
After installing the Rewrite Module, create a new folder/directory called C:\PHP on the Windows (C:) drive. This new folder will be used to unzip the contents from the PHP 7.3.8 (php-7.3.8-nts-Win32-VC15-x86.zip) zip folder downloaded from the installation files. Extract all contents from the zip folder into the C:\PHP folder.

</p>
<p>
Next, download and install MySQL 5.5.62 (mysql-5.5.62-win32.msi) from the installation files. Within the MySQL setup wizard, click "I agree" and select a Typical install and Install. Launch the Configuration Wizard after the installation. Select Standard Configuration and select Install As Windows Service and make sure Launch the MySQL Server automatically is checked. For credentials, the username will be root and the password is Password1. In a practical setting, the credentials will be decided by the user. For the purposes of this lab, the standard credentials root and Password1 will do.
